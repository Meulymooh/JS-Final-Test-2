# JS Final Test

Link to the result:


## What I managed to finish

* Step 1 to 7

## What I didn't finish

* Clearing the input field after adding item in the list

* Didn't insert the number of items in the parenthesis

* Error message in the console that I didn't have time to check (doesn't seem to impact the process)

=> I basically stopped at the same level as where I was in JS exercise 4.

=> Was checking this page when I stopped: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_close_list_items.asp

## What was the most difficult

Doing a task that I've never done before takes too much time.

## What I loved doing the most 

Redoing what I already achieved with the previous exercises. During the exercises it took me quite  a while to solve little instructions (e.g. adding a new row), but in the test it was much faster because I did remember things and knew where to find the information when I didn't.
