# JS Final Test

## What I managed to finish

Step 1 to 30

## What I didn't finish

* Instruction 13: the "delete item" crosses in the table were not clickable anymore after retrieving the list. I was blocked on that step so I just commented part of "retrieveData()" to be able to keep using the crosses.

## What was the most difficult

* Doing a task that I've never done before took too much time.
* The local storage was difficult. I didn't manage to make it work completely. I just commented part of "retrieveData()" to be able to continue.
* Not the most difficult thing, but at first the animation to hide rows worked only once. I should have probably used "animationSart()" and "animationEnd" but I was too lazy to rewrite the animation. I just created a function to reset it, then included the function into "showRows". I just spent too much time trying to find to easiest way to trigger the animation again since there are different possibilities.

## What I loved doing the most 

Redoing what I already achieved with the previous exercises. During the exercises it took me quite  a while to solve basic instructions (e.g. adding a new row), but in the test it was much faster because I did remember things and knew where to find the information when I didn't remember.

Continuing the test at home during the holidays was a slow process but I learned a lot (I got "private lessons" from my very patient partner).

I worked on this exercise during the Easter holidays and the following week in class. Javascript became easier for me from around that time. I think I'm starting to understand the mechanism (especially loops and parameters that have been very difficult for me).
