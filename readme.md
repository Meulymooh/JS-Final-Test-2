# JS Final Test

Link to the result:


## What I managed to finish

* Step 1 to 18

## What I didn't finish

* Instruction 13: the cross is not clickable anymore after retrieving the list.

## What was the most difficult

Doing a task that I've never done before takes too much time.

## What I loved doing the most 

Redoing what I already achieved with the previous exercises. During the exercises it took me quite  a while to solve little instructions (e.g. adding a new row), but in the test it was much faster because I did remember things and knew where to find the information when I didn't.

Continuing the test from home is a slow process. Not sure I'll be able to finish by the end of the week.
